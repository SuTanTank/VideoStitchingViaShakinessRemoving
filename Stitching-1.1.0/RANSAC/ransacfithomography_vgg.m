% RANSACFITHOMOGRAPHY - fits 2D homography using RANSAC
%
% Usage:   [H, inliers] = ransacfithomography_vgg(x1, x2, t)
%
% Arguments:
%          x1  - 2xN or 3xN set of homogeneous points.  If the data is
%                2xN it is assumed the homogeneous scale factor is 1.
%          x2  - 2xN or 3xN set of homogeneous points such that x1<->x2.
%          t   - The distance threshold between data point and the model
%                used to decide whether a point is an inlier or not. 
%                Note that point coordinates are normalised to that their
%                mean distance from the origin is sqrt(2).  The value of
%                t should be set relative to this, say in the range 
%                0.001 - 0.01  
%
% Note that it is assumed that the matching of x1 and x2 are putative and it
% is expected that a percentage of matches will be wrong.
%
% Returns:
%          H       - The 3x3 homography such that x2 = H*x1.
%          inliers - An array of indices of the elements of x1, x2 that were
%                    the inliers for the best model.

    % Normalise each set of points so that the origin is at centroid and

    % function will not - so it is best that we normalise beforehand.
